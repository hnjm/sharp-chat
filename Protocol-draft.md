# Sock Chat Protocol Information
The protocol operates on a websocket in text mode. Messages sent between the client and server are a series of concatenated strings delimited by the vertical tab character, represented in most languages by the escape sequence `\t` and defined in ASCII as `0x09`.
The first string in this concatenation must be the packet identifier, sent as an `int`.

Newer versions of the protocol are implemented as extensions, a client for Version 1 should have no trouble using a server built for Version 2 as long as authentication is understood.

The current stable version of the protocol is **Version 1**.


## Types

### `bool`
A value that indicates a true or a false state. `0` represents false and anything non-`0` represents true, please stick to `1` for representing true though.


### `int`
Any number ranging from `-9007199254740991` to `9007199254740991`, `Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER` and `Number.MIN_SAFE_INTEGER` in JavaScript.


### `string`
Any printable unicode character, except `\t` which is used to separate packets.


### `timestamp`
Extends `int`, contains a second based UNIX timestamp.


### `channel name`
A `string` containing only alphanumeric characters (any case), `-` or `_`.


### `session id`
A `string` containing only alphanumeric characters (any case), `-` or `_`.


### `color`
Any valid value for the CSS `color` property.
Further documentation can be found [on MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/color_value).


### `message flags`
Message flags alter how a message should be displayed to the client, these are all `bool` values.
The parts are as follows:

 - Username should appear using a **bold** font.
 - Username should appear using a *cursive* font.
 - Username should appear __underlined__.
 - A colon `:` should be displayed between the username and the message.
 - The message was sent privately, directly to the current user.

As an example, the most common message flagset is `10010`. This indicates a bold username with a colon separator.


### `user permissions`
User permissions are a set of flags separated by either the form feed character (`\f` / `0x0C`) or a space (<code> </code> / `0x20`).
The reason there are two options is due to a past mixup that we now have to live with.
Which of the methods is used remains consistent per server however, so the result of a test can be cached.

    <tr>
        <td><code>int</code></td>
        <td>Rank of the user. Used to determine what channels a user can access or what other users the user can moderate.</td>

## Client Packets

## Commands
Actions sent through messages prefixed with `/`. Arguments are described as `[name]`, optional arguments as `[name?]`.

### `/afk`: Setting status to away
Marks the current user as afk, the first 5 characters from the user string are prefixed uppercase to the current username prefixed by `&amp;lt;` and suffixed by `&amp;gt;_` resulting in a username that looks like `&lt;AWAY&gt;_flash` if `/afk away` is ran by the user `flash`. If no reason is specified "`AFK`" is used.

#### Format
```
/afk [reason?]
```


### `/nick`: Change nickname
Temporarily changes the user's nickname, generally with a prefix such as `~` to avoid name clashing with real users. If the user's original name or no argument at all is specified, the command returns the user's name to its original state without the prefix.

#### Format
```
/nick [name?]
```

#### Responses
 - `cmdna`: User is not allowed to change their own nickname.
 - `nameinuse`: The specified nickname is already in use by another user.
 - `nick`: Username has changed.


### `/msg`: Sending a Private Message
Sends a private message to another user. In implementations of Version 2 or above this should create a private channel that the user can actually join.

#### Format

/msg [username] [message]
```

#### Aliases
 - `/whisper`

#### Responses
 - `cmderr`: Missing username and/or message arguments.
 - `usernf`: Target user could not be found by the server.


### `/me`: Describing an action
Sends a message but with flags `11000` instead of the regular `10010`, used to describe an action.

#### Format
```
/me [message]
```

#### Aliases
 - `/action`


### `/who`: Requesting a user list
Requests a list of users either currently online on the server in general or in a channel. If no argument is specified it'll return all users on the server, if a channel is specified it'll return all users in that channel.

#### Format
```

```

#### Responses

 - `whoerr`: The user does not have access to the channel.
 - `whochan`: Listing of users in the channel.
 - `who`: Listing of users in the server.


### `/delete`: Deleting a message or channel
Due to an oversight in the original implementation, this command was specified to be both the command for deleting messages and for channels. Fortunately messages always have numeric IDs and channels must start with an alphabetic character. Thus if the argument is entirely numeric this function acts as an alias for `/delmsg`, otherwise `/delchan`.

#### Format
```
/delete [channel name or message id]
```

#### Responses
Inherits the responses of whichever command is forwarded to.


### `/join`: Joining a channel
Switches or joins the current user to a different channel.

In Version 2 with the MCHAN capability a user can be in more than one channel so the behaviour of this command changes to just joining the new channel rather than also immediately leaving previous channel.

```
/join [channel] [password?]
```

#### Responses
 - `nochan`: The given channel does not exist.
 - `ipchan`: The client does not have the required rank to enter the given channel.
 - `nopwchan`: A password is required to enter the given channel.

### `/leave`: Leaving a channel
Leave a specified channel.

Added in Version 2 through the MCHAN capability. The command should pretend it doesn't exist if MCHAN isn't part of the session's capabilities.

#### Format
```
/leave [channel]
```

#### Responses
 - `nocmd`: The client tried to run this command without specifying the `MCHAN` capability.


### `/create`: Creating a channel
Creates a new channel.

#### Format
```
/create [rank?] [name...]
```

If the first argument is numeric, it is taken as the minimum required rank to join the channel. All further arguments are glued with underscores to create the channel name.

#### Responses
 - `cmdna`: The client is not allowed to create channels.
 - `cmderr`: The command is formatted incorrectly.
